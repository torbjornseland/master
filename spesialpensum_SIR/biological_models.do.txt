===== Introduction to epidemic models =====
Throughout the history large epidemic diseases has spread around the world. Often over large geographical areas. These diseases has done great harm on the population, and millions of people has died. Black Death and Cholera are epidemics that has moved over large distances, both into Europe. When Black Death came to Europe in 1347, it killed about a third of the population, which at that time was about 85 million. These diseases often gave physical symptoms, which has been important knowledge through history for preventing new outburst and to cure already infected humans. These diseases has various outbreaks, but often related to connection between humans and animals. Malaria is an example of a disease that transmits from mosquito to human. But there have been various explanations of the spread and cause of epidemics. AIDS(autoimmune deficiency syndrome) has been ascribed by many as a punishment sent by God.

The first major epidemic in the U.S.A was the Yellow Fever, discovered in 1793 in Philadelphia. About 5000 died out of a population of around 50 000. About 20 000 fled the city and the situation was quite chaotic. This had a major impact on the subsequent life and politics of the country. The power of a disease can do larger damage, with respect to death, than a war.

After the world war II, public health strategy has focused on elimination and control of organisms which cause disease. United Nations sat in 1978 a goal to eradication all disease by 2000. This was before AIDS was recognized, but a large job has been done and smallpox is an example on a disease that was last seen in Somalia in 1977.

Another important aspect in the current spread of diseases, is the displacement of human populations. About a million people cross international borders daily. The growth of human population, especially in underdeveloped countries, is also a factor that affects spread, specially microbes. These conditions played a key role in the spread of HIV(human immunodeficiency) in the 1980's. World Health Organization has estimated that around 30 million are at current time infected with the HIV virus.

Knowledge through history is important for the control of different epidemics, but also important in detecting new diseases. The plague of Athens had been studied in great detail by Thucydides in 430-438 BC. Similar had been done with the 'sweating sickness' in the late 15th and first of the 16th centuries in England. The symptoms of 'sweating sickness' was detected in 1993 in the Southwest U.S.A. Here the disease was called hanta virus. There is likely that this is the same disease, but that the 'sweating sickness' has been dormant for couple of hundred years.

There are four main microorganisms that can be disease-causing. These are; viruses, bacteria, parasites and fungi. This chapter will focus on the population dynamics. Spatiotemporal models will also be studied. These mathematical models has been important for the combating of the diseases. Both in describing the movement pattern but also in giving reasoned estimated numbers for the level of vaccination.

===== Simple Epidemic models =====
These models that will be shown in this chapter, will have a constant population. This may differ from the real world. Another assumption that has to be done, is how the population interact. This has to be similar for the whole area that is modeled. The population can be divided into three different groups. The first group is Susceptible,$S$, which consist of humans that are healthy and at risk of becoming infected. Infective,$I$,this group has the disease or only carriers of the disease. This group can infect the Susceptible. The last group is the removed, $R$. This group consist of either dead or recovered recovered humans, often people that already have had the disease. The natural order for a human is,
!bt
\begin{equation}
S \rightarrow I \rightarrow R.
\end{equation}
!et
This model is called $SIR$ model, but the number of classes can be changed. $SI$ only consist of the two first groups and $SEIR$ has added an extra class $E$, where the disease is latent. This can be used to model the incubation time. 
<linebreak>
<linebreak>
A couple of important assumptions that has to be done for the model, are the transmission of the infection and incubation period. These are reflected in the terms of the equations. The amount of people in each class can be seen as a function of time, expressed as $S(t),I(t)$ and $R(t)$. The growth of $I$ caused by Susceptible, can be viewed as a rate proportional to the number of Infective and Susceptible multiplied by a constant,$rSI$, where $r>0$. This constant controls the efficiency of the transmission from $S$ to $I$. This will appear as a reduction in the function $S(t)$. The rate of removal from Infective to Removed can be viewed as the number of Infective times a constant,$aI$, where $a>0$ controls the time spent in the Infection state. The incubation time is here negligible. This could have been taken into account by the $SEIR$ model. The dynamic model will be,
!bt
\begin{align*} label{eq:SIR_model}
\frac{dS}{dt} =& -rSI \\
\frac{dI}{dt} =& rSI-aI \\
\frac{dR}{dt} =& aI
\end{align*}
!et
This model is called the Kermack-McKendrick(1927) model. Is is considered that the classes are uniformly mixed and that there is equal probability for contact for all individuals. This assumptions will not be correct for all diseases, especially sexually transmitted diseases. The total number for the population will stay constant. This can be seen on the total change in the classes,
!bt
\begin{equation}
\frac{dS}{dt} + \frac{dI}{dt} + \frac{dR}{dt} = 0
\end{equation}
!et

Therefore the total size of the population, $N$, will be constant. 

=== Threshold phenomenon ===
An important question to study when looking the at an epidemic model, is the threshold phenomenon. To cause an epidemic situation, the model need to fulfill $I(t)> I_0$ for some $t>0$, where $I_0$ describe the initial condition for Infective. The initial conditions can be given as,
!bt
\begin{equation}
S(0)=S_0 > 0,\hspace{8mm} I(0)=I_0>0,\hspace{8mm} R(0) =0.
\end{equation}
!et
The initial conditions for Susceptible and Infective combined with $r$ and $a$ will control the epidemic situation. These will affect the spread if the infection. From equation (ref{eq:SIR_model}) the function for Infection at initial time can be written,
!bt
\begin{equation}
\left[\frac{dI}{dt}\right]_{t=0} = I_0(rS_0-a)
\end{equation}
!et
The expression inside the brackets controls the change in $I$. The function will increase if $S_0 > \frac{a}{r}$, this will therefore be the threshold value for the function. This can be shown with a Phase trajectories of the Susceptible and the Infective.  

FIGURE:[plots/threshold_phenomenon.png]

The simulation shows that when the value of $S$ is larger than $\frac{a}{r}$ the value of $I$ is increasing. But when $S = \frac{a}{r}$, the value of $I$ reaches a maximum value and then start to decrease. The reproduction rate can be described
!bt
\begin{equation}
R_0 = \frac{rS_0}{a}
\end{equation}
!et
If $R_0 > 1$ it will cause an epidemic reaction. This parameter is crucial in the understanding with the work with the disease. To be able to keep $R_0 < 1$ will prevent a dispersion. Global vaccination programs are an effective way to get control. Smallpox is an example on a disease that has been close to eradicating around the world. This is caused because of the reduction of Susceptible. But there is always a small chance for side effects when using vaccination. And therefore some people choose to skip it. This is quite critical for the fight of total eradication. Not only is it a big risk for the specific person, but it also increase the number of Susceptible. An important thing to remember is that an epidemic situation can quickly grow again if the reproduction rate reaches the threshold

Some analytical studies can be done on the simple model by using (ref{eq:SIR_model}).
!bt
\begin{equation} 
\frac{dI}{dS} = -\frac{(rS-a)I}{rSI} = -1 + \frac{\rho}{S},\hspace{8mm}\rho=\frac{a}{r}, (I\neq0).
\end{equation}
!et
The singularities will all lie on the I=0 axis. This equation can be integrated and will then give phase plane trajectories in the (I,S) plane. This can be seen in the figure above.
!bt
\begin{equation} label{eq:constant}
I+S-\rho \ln S = constant = I_0 + S_0 - \rho \ln S_0
\end{equation}
!et
An observation is that all initial values satisfy $I_0+S_0=N$ since $R(0) = 0$. This will change when $t>0$. If a disease appear it would be important to know the severity of the disease, and also if it can develops to an epidemic. Therefore the maximum value of I,$I_{max}$ which occurs when $S=\rho$. At this point, $\frac{dI}{dt}=0$. This can be found by using (ref{eq:constant})
!bt
\begin{align*}
I+S-\rho \ln S =& I_0 + S_0 - \rho \ln S_0\\
I_{max}+\rho-\rho \ln \rho =& I_0 + S_0 - \rho \ln S_0\\
I_{max}=&- \rho+\rho \ln \rho + I_0 + S_0 - \rho \ln S_0\\
I_{max}=&N - \rho + \rho \ln\frac{\rho}{S_0}\\
\end{align*}
!et
The trajectory in the figure above shows quite clear the difference between $S_0 > \rho$ and $S_0< \rho$. In the cases where $S_0$ is higher, an increasing of the I will happend. While a decreasing will happend when $S_0$ is lower. An example can be shown. The $\rho$ in the simulation above is sat to 35. While $N=100$ for all trajectories. A calculation can be done on the lowest trajectory which has the initial conditions $S_0= 90$ and $I_0= 10$
!bt
\begin{align*}
I_max =& N-\rho + \rho \ln \frac{\rho}{S_0}\\
I_max =& 100-35 + 35 \ln \frac{35}{90}\\
I_max =& 31.94
\end{align*}
!et
This situation causes an epidemic situation since $I_{max}$ is quite much higher than the initial condition. The figure above shows that the trajectory of this function starts decreasing after this point. In the two upper trajectories $S_0< \rho$, then $I$ will decrease from initial condition. $I$ will move towards zero as $t\rightarrow \infty$.
