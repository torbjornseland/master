<h2>Introduction to epidemic models  <a name="___sec0"></a></h2>
Throughout the history large epidemic diseases has spread around the world. Often over large geographical areas. These diseases has done great harm on the population, and millions of people has died. Black Death and Cholera are epidemics that has moved over large distances, both into Europe. When Black Death came to Europe in 1347, it killed about a third of the population, which at that time was about 85 million. These diseases often gave physical symptoms, which has been important knowledge through history for preventing new outburst and to cure already infected humans. These diseases has various outbreaks, but often related to connection between humans and animals. Malaria is an example of a disease that transmits from mosquito to human. But there have been various explanations of the spread and cause of epidemics. AIDS(autoimmune deficiency syndrome) has been ascribed by many as a punishment sent by God.
<br />
<br />
The first major epidemic in the U.S.A was the Yellow Fever, discovered in 1793 in Philadelphia. About 5000 died out of a population of around 50 000. About 20 000 fled the city and the situation was quite chaotic. This had a major impact on the subsequent life and politics of the country. The power of a disease can do larger damage, with respect to death, than a war.
<br />
<br />
After the world war II, public health strategy has focused on elimination and control of organisms which cause disease. United Nations sat in 1978 a goal to eradication all disease by 2000. This was before AIDS was recognized, but a large job has been done and smallpox is an example on a disease that was last seen in Somalia in 1977.
<br />
<br />
Another important aspect in the current spread of diseases, is the displacement of human populations. About a million people cross international borders daily. The growth of human population, especially in underdeveloped countries, is also a factor that affects spread, specially microbes. These conditions played a key role in the spread of HIV(human immunodeficiency) in the 1980's. World Health Organization has estimated that around 30 million are at current time infected with the HIV virus.
<br />
<br />
Knowledge through history is important for the control of different epidemics, but also important in detecting new diseases. The plague of Athens had been studied in great detail by Thucydides in 430-438 BC. Similar had been done with the 'sweating sickness' in the late 15th and first of the 16th centuries in England. The symptoms of 'sweating sickness' was detected in 1993 in the Southwest U.S.A. Here the disease was called hanta virus. There is likely that this is the same disease, but that the 'sweating sickness' has been dormant for couple of hundred years.
<br />
<br />
There are four main microorganisms that can be disease-causing. These are; viruses, bacteria, parasites and fungi. This chapter will focus on the population dynamics. Spatiotemporal models will also be studied. These mathematical models has been important for the combating of the diseases. Both in describing the movement pattern but also in giving reasoned estimated numbers for the level of vaccination.

<h2>Simple Epidemic models  <a name="___sec1"></a></h2>
These models that will be shown in this chapter, will have a constant population. This may differ from the real world. Another assumption that has to be done, is how the population interact. This has to be similar for the whole area that is modeled. The population can be divided into three different groups. The first group is Susceptible,$S$, which consist of humans that are healthy and at risk of becoming infected. Infective,$I$,this group has the disease or only carriers of the disease. This group can infect the Susceptible. The last group is the removed, \( R \). This group consist of either dead or recovered recovered humans, often people that already have had the disease. The natural order for a human is,
$$
\begin{equation}
S \rightarrow I \rightarrow R.
\end{equation}
$$

This model is called \( SIR \) model, but the number of classes can be changed. \( SI \) only consist of the two first groups and \( SEIR \) has added an extra class \( E \), where the disease is latent. This can be used to model the incubation time. 
<br />
<br />
A couple of important assumptions that has to be done for the model, are the transmission of the infection and incubation period. These are reflected in the terms of the equations. The amount of people in each class can be seen as a function of time, expressed as \( S(t),I(t) \) and \( R(t) \). The growth of \( I \) caused by Susceptible, can be viewed as a rate proportional to the number of Infective and Susceptible multiplied by a constant,$rSI$, where \( r>0 \). This constant controls the efficiency of the transmission from \( S \) to \( I \). This will appear as a reduction in the function \( S(t) \). The rate of removal from Infective to Removed can be viewed as the number of Infective times a constant,$aI$, where \( a>0 \) controls the time spent in the Infection state. The incubation time is here negligible. This could have been taken into account by the \( SEIR \) model. The dynamic model will be,
$$
\begin{align*} \label{eq:SIR_model}
\frac{dS}{dt} =& -rSI \\
\frac{dI}{dt} =& rSI-aI \\
\frac{dR}{dt} =& aI
\end{align*}
$$

This model is called the Kermack-McKendrick(1927) model. Is is considered that the classes are uniformly mixed and that there is equal probability for contact for all individuals. This assumptions will not be correct for all diseases, especially sexually transmitted diseases.&#160;The total number for the population will stay constant. This can be seen on the total change in the classes,
$$
\begin{equation}
\frac{dS}{dt} + \frac{dI}{dt} + \frac{dR}{dt} = 0
\end{equation}
$$


<p>
Therefore the total size of the population, \( N \), will be constant. 
$$
\begin{equation} \label{eq:SIR_N}
S(t)+I(t)+R(t) = N
\end{equation}
$$

<h3>Threshold phenomenon  <a name="___sec2"></a></h3>

An important question to study when looking the at an epidemic model, is the threshold phenomenon. To cause an epidemic situation, the model need to fulfill \( I(t)> I_0 \) for some \( t>0 \), where \( I_0 \) describe the initial condition for Infective. The initial conditions can be given as,
$$
\begin{equation}
S(0)=S_0 > 0,\hspace{8mm} I(0)=I_0>0,\hspace{8mm} R(0) =0.
\end{equation}
$$

The initial conditions for Susceptible and Infective combined with \( r \) and \( a \) will control the epidemic situation. These will affect the spread if the infection. From equation \eqref{eq:SIR_model} the function for Infection at initial time can be written,
$$
\begin{equation}
\left[\frac{dI}{dt}\right]_{t=0} = I_0(rS_0-a)
\end{equation}
$$

The expression inside the brackets controls the change in \( I \). The function will increase if \( S_0 > \frac{a}{r} \), this will therefore be the threshold value for the function. This can be shown with a Phase trajectories of the Susceptible and the Infective.  

<p>
<center><p><img src="plots/threshold_phenomenon.png" align="bottom" ></p></center>

<p>
The simulation shows that when the value of \( S \) is larger than \( \frac{a}{r} \) the value of \( I \) is increasing. But when \( S = \frac{a}{r} \), the value of \( I \) reaches a maximum value and then start to decrease. The reproduction rate can be described
$$
\begin{equation}
R_0 = \frac{rS_0}{a}
\end{equation}
$$

If \( R_0 > 1 \) it will cause an epidemic reaction. This parameter is crucial in the understanding with the work with the disease. To be able to keep \( R_0 < 1 \) will prevent a dispersion. Global vaccination programs are an effective way to get control. Smallpox is an example on a disease that has been close to eradicating around the world. This is caused because of the reduction of Susceptible. But there is always a small chance for side effects when using vaccination. And therefore some people choose to skip it. This is quite critical for the fight of total eradication. Not only is it a big risk for the specific person, but it also increase the number of Susceptible. An important thing to remember is that an epidemic situation can quickly grow again if the reproduction rate reaches the threshold
<br />
<br />
Some analytical studies can be done on the simple model by using \eqref{eq:SIR_model}.
$$
\begin{equation} 
\frac{dI}{dS} = -\frac{(rS-a)I}{rSI} = -1 + \frac{\rho}{S},\hspace{8mm}\rho=\frac{a}{r}, (I\neq0).
\end{equation}
$$

The singularities will all lie on the I=0 axis. This equation can be integrated and will then give phase plane trajectories in the (I,S) plane. This can be seen in the figure above.
$$
\begin{equation} \label{eq:constant}
I+S-\rho \ln S = constant = I_0 + S_0 - \rho \ln S_0
\end{equation}
$$

An observation is that all initial values satisfy \( I_0+S_0=N \) since \( R(0) = 0 \). This will change when \( t>0 \). If a disease appear it would be important to know the severity of the disease, and also if it can develops to an epidemic. Therefore the maximum value of I,$I_{max}$ which occurs when \( S=\rho \). At this point, \( \frac{dI}{dt}=0 \). This can be found by using \eqref{eq:constant}
$$
\begin{align*} \label{eq:max_I}
I+S-\rho \ln S =& I_0 + S_0 - \rho \ln S_0\\
I_{max}+\rho-\rho \ln \rho =& I_0 + S_0 - \rho \ln S_0\\
I_{max}=&- \rho+\rho \ln \rho + I_0 + S_0 - \rho \ln S_0\\
I_{max}=&N - \rho + \rho \ln\frac{\rho}{S_0}\\
\end{align*}
$$

The trajectory in the figure above shows quite clear the difference between \( S_0 > \rho \) and \( S_0< \rho \). In the cases where \( S_0 \) is higher, an increasing of the I will happend. While a decreasing will happend when \( S_0 \) is lower. An example can be shown. The \( \rho \) in the simulation above is sat to 35. While \( N=100 \) for all trajectories. A calculation can be done on the lowest trajectory which has the initial conditions \( S_0= 90 \) and \( I_0= 10 \)
$$
\begin{align*}
I_max =& N-\rho + \rho \ln \frac{\rho}{S_0}\\
I_max =& 100-35 + 35 \ln \frac{35}{90}\\
I_max =& 31.94
\end{align*}
$$

This situation causes an epidemic situation since \( I_{max} \) is quite much higher than the initial condition. The figure above shows that the trajectory of this function starts decreasing after this point. In the two upper trajectories \( S_0< \rho \), then \( I \) will decrease from initial condition. \( I(\infty)\rightarrow 0 \) will move towards zero as \( t\rightarrow \infty \).
<br />
<br />
The Susceptible, \( S \) will always has a decreasing solution since \( \frac{dS}{dt}<0 \) when \( S\neq0 \) and \( I\neq0 \). By using \eqref{eq:SIR_model},
$$
\begin{equation}
\frac{dS}{dR} = -\frac{S}{\rho}
\end{equation}
$$

By some integration the equation can be expressed
$$
\begin{equation} \label{eq:S_infty}
S = S_0e^{-R/\rho} \geq S_0e^{-R/\rho} > 0
\end{equation}
$$

As \( t\rightarrow \infty \) the total number of Susceptible will be in the range \( 0< S(\infty)\leq N \). This range can be reduced even more by knowing that \( I \) will increase as long \( S> \rho \). This will lead a decreasing for \( S \). The number of Susceptible will be \( 0< S(\infty)\leq \rho \). Since \( I \) will be zero when the time goes towards infinity, the Removed class can be described,$R(\infty)= N -S(\infty). Now this can be added into \eqref{eq:S_infty}, which gives,
$$
\begin{equation}
S(\infty) = S_0 \exp\left(-\frac{N-S(\infty)}{\rho}\right)
\end{equation}
$$

\( S(\infty) \) be found as the positive root in the transcendental equation. This can be used to find the total number of people who catch the disease.
$$
\begin{equation}
I_{total} = I_0 + S_0 -S(\infty)
\end{equation}
$$

This analysis is based on the important implication that the disease dies out because the Infective class goes towards zero, and not because of the lack of susceptibles. This is the case for all diseases and the important factor is the removal rate, \( \rho \). This will affect the number of susceptible that can be infected. This removal rate will also varies with respect to different parameters as population density, incubation time and the length of the period of sickness. The two equations (<a name="eq:max_I"></a>) and (<a name="eq:total_I"></a>) gives an understanding of the maximum number of infective and the total number, but this demands the exact number of \( \rho,I_0,S_0 \) and \( S \), which is quite hard to get exactly in a real situation. The challenging thing is often to know how many that are infected at each time. The easiest group to control, is the number of removed, \( R \). This group is assisted with medical help. So to model a realistic situation, the number of removed as a function of time \( dR/dt \) is a realistic model. Here the equations from \eqref{eq:SIR_model} ,\eqref{eq:SIR_N} and \eqref{eq:S_infty} can be used.
$$
\begin{align*} \label{eq:dR_normal}
\frac{dR}{dt} =& aI\\
=& a(N-R-S)\\
=& a(N-R-S_0e^{-R/\rho})
\end{align*}
$$

This solution also demands several parameters as \( a \),$r$,$S_0$ and \( N \) to solve this numerically. Then it is normal to adjust the parameters after the epidemic to get the best result as possible. But it the epidemic is not to large, \( R/\rho \) will be quite small, at least under 1. Then another model from Kermack and McKendrick(1927) can be used.
$$
\begin{equation}
\frac{dR}{dt} = a(N-S_0+(\frac{S_0}{\rho}-1)R-\frac{S_0R^2}{2\rho^2})
\end{equation}
$$

By factoring the right-hand side of this equation, the equation can be integrated. After some complicated steps the equation can be given by \eqref{eq:dR_normal} is used in my equation
$$
\begin{equation} \label{eq:R_small}
R(t) = \frac{\rho^2}{S_0}\left[\left(\frac{S_0}{\rho}-1\right)+\alpha \tanh\left(\frac{\alpha at}{2}-\phi\right)\right]
\end{equation}
$$

where
$$
\begin{equation}
\alpha = \left[\left(\frac{S_0}{\rho}-1\right)+\frac{2S_0(N-S_0)}{\rho^2}\right]^{1/2}, \phi= \tanh^{-1}\frac{1}{\alpha}\left(\frac{S_0}{\rho}-1\right)
\end{equation}
$$

This will give
$$
\DeclareMathOperator{\sech}{sech}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:dR_small}
\frac{dR}{dt} = \frac{a\alpha^2\rho^2}{2S_0}\sech^2\left(\frac{\alpha at}{2}-\phi\right)
\end{equation}
$$

The advantage with (<a name="eq:dR_small"></a>) is that this equation only consist of three parameters. This is easier to adjust to a real situation. If the exact number of the removed class, \( R \), is collected and the epidemic situation is quite small, the model \eqref{eq:R_small} should be used. Both these two models demands that \( R/\rho \) is quite small. It not the model \eqref{dR_normal} has to be used.
<br />
<br />

<h3>Bombay Plague Epidemic  <a name="___sec3"></a></h3>

The model \eqref{dR_small} was used by Kermack and McKendrick(1927) to model the epidemic in Bombay. The data that they were able to get was the number of deaths per week. By these result they were able to modify the equation to simulate the number of deaths per week. The three parameters were
$$
\DeclareMathOperator{\sech}{sech}
\begin{equation}
\frac{dR}{dt} = 890\sech^2(0.2t-3.4)
\end{equation}
$$

And the function of deaths per week can be modeled,

<h3>Epidemic in an English Boarding School 1978  <a name="___sec4"></a></h3>

The British medical journal had in 1978 a report from a boarding school in England. One of the boys had brought with him a disease back to the school. Since this was a boarding school, they were totally isolated from other and a closed system to model with the system. The following parameters has been used for the simulation, \( N=763 \),$S_0=762$,$I_0=1$,$\rho=202$ and \( r=2.18 x 10^{-3} \). Here \( S_0 > \rho \) and an increasing of \( I \) can be expected.

<p>
<center><p><img src="plots/English_boarding_school.png" align="bottom" ></p></center>

<p>
By some variation in \( \rho \), the results from the epidemic could turn out quite different. Here are some examples where \( \rho \) varies from 50 up to 400.

<p>
<center><p><img src="plots/English_boarding_school_changes.png" align="bottom" ></p></center>

<p>
A small \( \rho \) gives an aggressive disease, since \( I \) will increase until \( S= \rho \). The class of infective will increase until the number of susceptible falls down to 50. This results in in a total majority of infected students. A large \( \rho \) has the opposite effect. The total number of susceptible stays around 170 students, and will go towards steady number as \( I(\infty)=0 \).

<h2>Zombification  <a name="___sec5"></a></h2>
One of the worst epidemics that can affect the human population is a zombie attack. This will have a huge impact on the way humans to day live. Several movies and series has illustrated this type of situation, but by using mathematical models this is possible to simulate. There have been written a couple of papers about this.  Munz et al. used  the SIR model to simulate an possible upcoming zombiefication, where the infected class, \( I \), is switched with a zombie class, \( Z \). The following model was used,

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{dS}{dt} =& \Sigma -\beta SZ - \delta S \\
\frac{dZ}{dt} =& \beta SZ + \zeta R - \alpha SZ\\
\frac{dR}{dt} =& \delta S + \alpha SZ - \zeta R
\end{align*}
$$


<p>
This is a bit more complicated than the standard \( SIR \) model that was presented above. Here \( \Sigma \) describe the birthrate for new susceptibles. \( \frac{dS}{dt} \) is now able to be positive. \( \beta SZ \) describe the numbers of susceptible that become zombies, by interactions between the two groups. Similar as the case for \( rSI \). The last factor for the susceptible is \( \delta S \). This describe the number of naturals deaths among the group. \( \zeta R \) controls the number of removed that arises as zombies. To avoid total eradication the humans will try to fight back, \( \alpha SZ \), describe the number of zombies killed by humans in the zombie attacks. 
<br />
<br />
This model was challenged by the paper from Langtangen, Mardal and R&#248;tnes, where they developed another model. They added another class, \( I \), which here describe infected humans. This is a pre-zombie stadium, before becoming zombies. There is also added a function \( \omega(t) \), which creates a massive attack from the humans. This is controlled by time and give the susceptibles a chance to fight back. The system:
$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{dS}{dt} =& \Sigma -\beta SZ - \delta_SS \\
\frac{dI}{dt} =& \beta SZ - \varrho I - \delta_II\\
\frac{dZ}{dt} =& \varrho I- (\alpha+\omega(t))SZ + \zeta R\\
\frac{dR}{dt} =& \delta_SS +\delta_II -\zeta R + (\alpha+\omega(t))SZ 
\end{align*}
$$

The new elements are the different \( \delta \)'s, which describe the probability that the specific type is killed or dies. This can only harm the humans,$S$, or the infected group,$I$. The probability for a human to wake up as a zombie is here controlled by \( \varrho \). This will have major impact on the amount of zombies. In the system from Munz et al. everyone ended up as zombies. But in this case the result can variy from everyone down to none, if \( \varrho=0 \). The function:
$$
\begin{equation}
\omega(t) = a \sum^m_{i=0}\exp\left(\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{t-T_i}{\sigma}\right)^2\right)
\end{equation}
$$

controls the attacks from the susceptible will only be fired at choosen times. These are controlled by the parameters. \( a \) here works as a similar parameter as \( \alpha \), but will only active when the susceptible group is organized and ready to attack. \( T \) contains a list of numbers. This controls the time when the attacks will occur.
<br />
<br />
An important factor while modelling a zombie attack is the parameters. Since the ODE system from Langtangen, Mardal and R&#248;tnes will be the model that will be used as a standard, the choice of parameters will be based on their paper. Here they have chosen to divide a zombie outbreak into three different phases. The TV series Walking dead will be used as a reference here.

<p>
<b>The initial phase.</b>
<br />
In this phase the disease is yet not known and humans often tries to save the sick ones by taking them to hospitals or get some kind of treatment. Because of this ignorance related to the disease, the number of infected humans is high. This phase is often quite short and humans soon starts realise that the risk of saving other is really high. Walking Dead never shows anything from this phase, but the viewer only sees the damages when the main character sheriff Rick Grimes wakes up at the local hospital after a coma caused shooting accident. What he wakes up to is the major damage caused in the initial phase and the society is in the hysterical phase.
<br />
<br />
<b>The hysterical phase.</b>
<br />
Now the humans start to avoid the infected and some tries to fight them. The humans often gather in groups and try to find safe spots away from the zombies. Important emergency as weapons and food are their main priority. Barricades are build and the guarding is strict. When Rick Grimes wakes up, the hospital is abandoned and the halls are filled up with dead people. Quite fast he understand that he needs to reach safety and after a certain time he ends up in a camp far from the cities, where the zombies gathes.
<br />
<br />
<b>The counter attack.</b>
<br />
The time for a counter attack. The group of human has been able to get resources to fight back. The number of zombies has grown much higher than the remaining human population. But because of good organization the humans are able to provide major damage on the zombies. This can be seen in the series when the zombies get to close the camp. They respond with fight and kills an amount of zombies before leaving the camp.
<br />
<br />
The parameters that has been used in the modelling of the different phases are based in the movie "The Night of the living Dead". A thoroughly study of the parameters has been done by the authors, and this paper is not able to use the same amount of time. This would only result in a poor copy. But the values will be used. The first thing that is modeled is the initial phase. This is based on the situation where two humans runs into a zombie and one of then gets infected. The parameters for the simulation are set to \( S_0=60,I_0=3,\beta=0.0625,\alpha=a=0,\varrho=1,\delta_S =\delta_I = 0,\zeta=0 \). The program from LMR is used.

<p>
<center><p><img src="plots/LMR_zombie_initial_1.png" align="bottom" ></p></center>

<p>
Here a total eradication of the human population is about to happen in the 4 first hours. This is unlikely and \( \beta \) was adjusted to 0.03. This made the attacks from the zombies less effective. A deeper study is done on the effect of varying \( \beta \)
