<h2>Introduction to epidemic models  <a name="___sec0"></a></h2>
Throughout the history large epidemic diseases has spread around the world. Often over large geographical areas. These diseases has done great harm on the population, and millions of people has died. Black Death and Cholera are epidemics that has moved over large distances, both into Europe. When Black Death came to Europe in 1347, it killed about a third of the population, which at that time was about 85 million. These diseases often gave physical symptoms, which has been important knowledge through history for preventing new outburst and to cure already infected humans. These diseases has various outbreaks, but often related to connection between humans and animals. Malaria is an example of a disease that transmits from mosquito to human. But there have been various explanations of the spread and cause of epidemics. AIDS(autoimmune deficiency syndrome) has been ascribed by many as a punishment sent by God.
<br />
The first major epidemic in the U.S.A was the Yellow Fever, discovered in 1793 in Philadelphia. About 5000 died out of a population of around 50 000. About 20 000 fled the city and the situation was quite chaotic. This had a major impact on the subsequent life and politics of the country. The power of a disease can do larger damage, with respect to death, than a war.
<br />
After the world war II, public health strategy has focused on elimination and control of organisms which cause disease. United Nations sat in 1978 a goal to eradication all disease by 2000. This was before AIDS was recognized, but a large job has been done and smallpox is an example on a disease that was last seen in Somalia in 1977.
<br />
Another important aspect in the current spread of diseases, is the displacement of human populations. About an million people cross international borders daily. The growth of human population, especially in underdeveloped countries, is also a factor that affects spread, specially microbes. These played a key role in the spread of HIV(human immunodeficiency) in the 1980's.
