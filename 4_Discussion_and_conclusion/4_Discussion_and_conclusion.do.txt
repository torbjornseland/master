========= Discussion and conclusion =========
In this thesis, two examples have been used to simulate the three different epidemic models. The results have been analyzed and compared throughout the paper. Here, the most important analyzes and comparisons will be discussed and summarized. Based on this some conclusions will be made, and ideas for further work will be presented in section ref{section:4_further_work}

The first example was an English boarding school which was first simulated by the ODE model. This simulation was based on given parameter values from the British medical journal. One could see that the maximum concentration of the infected group could be found by Eq.(ref{eq:max_I}), and the numerical simulation gave the same result. By adjusting the parameter $\rho$ in Fig.(ref{fig:english_boarding}), the result from the epidemic disease changed. When $\rho$ was set to 50, it lead to total eradication of susceptible students during the first 10 days. However, by increasing $\rho$ to 400, the amount of susceptible students was 170.

The introduction of the PDE model, made it possible to compare results of different simulations. The PDE model was first simulated for the English boarding school with uniform distribution. This gave the same result as in the ODE model, which was expected. However, when the infected student was placed in center, the amount of susceptible students increased with 68 percent in 5 days. The disease was now less effective and one can see from Fig.(ref{fig:gauss_sub}) that the disease only spread to the students in the center. Another variation was made. By placing the student in the corner, the number of susceptible students increased to 70 percent in 5 days. To summarize, the same parameter values and size was used for all three simulations mentioned above, but the results differed widely.

In both the ODE model and the PDE model, the maximum value of infected was $\Imax=292$. This was not the result from the Random walk simulation. In the Random walk simulation the average maximum value of the infected group was $\Imax=263$, which is lower than for the other models. By studying Fig.(ref{fig:english_school_random}), one can see that the infected ODE is always within the range of the standard deviation for the Random walk simulation. The average value for the Random walk is based on 200 simulations. It would be interesting in further work to increase this number even more, to see in what degree that would affect the average value. Another element that the Random walk model added, was the chance of an epidemic disease to die out. 25 percent of the simulations resulted in no epidemic occurrence. The infected student was transposed to the removed group before he was able to infect other students. This would not be the case for the ODE and PDE model, since the reproduction rate was above one, as explained in section ref{section:1threshold_phenomenon}.

The second example was based on the TV series *Walking Dead*. Here, the amount in each group was known, and the parameter values for the ODE model were adjusted to fit the expected result. The parameter values $\beta$, $\varrho$ and $\alpha$ from the model in Eq.(ref{eq:LMR_model}) were adjusted for the different phases in *Walking Dead*, and based on this, the evolution in *Walking Dead* can be seen as realistic. However, the ODE model does not take the spatial factor into account. The position of the infected student had an effect on the result for the English boarding school. In the simulation of the PDE model one of the goals were to see if the size of the group of susceptible also had an effect on the result. The susceptible group was therefore split into three constellations of different sizes, called the small-,middle and large constellation. One zombie was placed in all three constellations, and the simulations showed that the loss of susceptible was proportional to the size of the constellation. For the small, middle and large constellation the loss of susceptible were 18,196 and 375 based on the Tab.(ref{table:compare_towns}). The middle group lost 97 percent susceptible based on the size of the constellation, which was the highest percentage in all three constellations. To summarize, the PDE simulations showed that the size of the susceptible group also affects the result. The last simulations of the PDE model were made in an attempt to implement human behavior. This was done by giving the zombie and infected restricted areas, in other words keeping them outside the buildings. The simulation shown in Fig.(ref{fig:frederikke_free_area}) gave the susceptible group in the buildings a greater chance of surviving. However, since the concentrations for each group in an PDE model goes towards equilibrium, the movement pattern differs from human behavior. As a conclusion, the goal of implementing human behavior would be easier to attain using a Random walk model.

To study the effect of the human behavior, the simulations of the Random walk model were run for a short amount of time. The condition *Moving smart*, where the zombies chase the susceptible humans, was used. With only one zombie at initial time, the result was zero loss for the susceptible group. This result was also due to equal moving speed for humans and zombies, which made the humans able to avoid battles. As a variation the simulation was performed with 10 zombies at initial time. This resulted in 87 humans after 3 minutes, compared to 297 humans in the Random walk simulation. These results are based on the average value of a set of simulations. However, if one look more closely at the different results of the simulations with the condition *Moving smart*, 15 of 100 simulations resulted in eradication of the susceptible group after 3 minutes. After 10 minutes the result was increased to 29 simulations. This was not the case for any of the simulations with the Random walk condition. However, the condition *Moving smart* would not be a realistic movement pattern in all situations.

The last simulations of the Random walk model, combined the conditions *Random walk* and *Moving smart*. In the *Initial phase*, the condition was set to Random walk, while it was changed to the Moving smart condition in the *Hysterical phase*. One set of simulations were run with the ability for all groups to move freely within one area, while another set of simulations were modeled with restricted areas for the zombie group. These were compared to the ODE simulation from the second chapter. The parameter values and the amount wass equal for all simulations. After the *Initial phase*, there were 71 susceptible left in the ODE simulation, 278 in the simulation where the groups could move freely and 331 in the simulation with restricted areas for the zombies. To summarize, adding human behavior to the model increases the chance for humans to survive.

As a final summary of the main results in this thesis, one can say that the ODE model can be adapted to problems, where the result is already known. The model can then be used to study the evolution of the epidemic disease. However, it does not take the spatial factor into account. This makes the model weak, predicting the spread of a disease. The PDE model is able to implement the spatial factor. The results from the English boarding school and the TV series *Walking Dead* showed the effect of the position. However, when wanting to add human behavior, this model becomes weak. It offers limited possibilities of applying movement pattern that can be seen as realistic, especially for small groups. The Random walk model was able to take the spatial effect into account and implement human behavior. These two factors gave the most realistic simulations. A drawback was the high calculating capacity. The longest Random walk simulation was 34 minutes long. Making longer simulations with a higher amount would demand more calculating capacity than in the other models.  

===== Further work =====
label{section:4_further_work}
As said in the introduction of the thesis, a couple of choices were made. The first one was that systems would be modeled for a short period of time. The second one was that all models would be simulated as closed systems, which meant using a certain number of people and a certain time frame. In further work it would be interesting to expand the Random walk model by using parallelization.This would make it possible to make longer simulations with a higher amount.
<linebreak>

Another idea for further work is to add more skills to the different groups in Random walk model. The effect of these changes could be compared to the effect of varying the parameter values. The skills and strength of a human was similar for all in the susceptible group. This is not authentic. In the real world, all humans have different skills and would behave differently when meeting a zombie. Interesting skills to add could be:
* weapons for the susceptible group
* noise sensitivity for the zombie group
* the ability to cooperate within the groups.
This would make the Random walk model more authentic in simulation of a zombie outburst.

A final suggestion for further study is based on the movement speed of the three groups *Susceptible*, *Infected* and *Zombie*. In this thesis the movement speed of the three groups has been equal. However, in *Walking Dead*, the average speed was higher for the susceptible group, than for the two others. Further studies of how this would affect the results could be interesting.
