This thesis studies and compares three different ways of modeling epidemic diseases. The simulations are done for a small group over a short time period. In the first chapter an ODE model is presented. This is used to model two different examples of epidemic systems. The second chapter introduces a PDE model, which also takes the geographic position into account. The parameters from the first model are used for the PDE model, to study the spatial effect. Random walk is used as the third model. Here, human behavior has been added to the model to achieve a more realistic result. Throughout the thesis two examples are used, namely an influenza outbreak in an English boarding school and a potential zombiefication based on the TV series *Walking Dead*. The results from these two cases are used to compare the different models.
