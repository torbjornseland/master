This thesis study and compare three different models for modeling epidemic diseases. The simulations are done for a small group over a short time period. In the first chapter an ODE model is presented. This is used to model two different examples of epidemic systems. The second chapter introduce a PDE model, which also takes the position into account. The parameters from the first model is used for the PDE model, to study the spatial effect. Random walk is used as the third model. Here, human behavior has been added to the model to achieve a more realistic result. Throughout the thesis two examples are used, namely a influenza outbreak in an English boarding school and a potential zombiefication based on the TV series *Walking Dead*. The results from these two cases are used to compare the different models.
