===== Diffusion equation and random walks =====
The British Botanist R. Brown developed a theory by studying how pollen dispersed in water. This idea is called Brownian motion and can be used to describe a group of particles spreading. The function $w(x,t)dx$ can be defined as the probability of finding a given number of particles in an interval with size $dx$. This function is the $PDF$ as explained in the section above. The flux of particles that passing a point $x$, can be described by $j(x,t)$. This flow is proportionally with the gradient of the $PDF$,
!bt
\begin{equation}
j(x,t) = -D\frac{\partial w(x,t)}{\partial x}
\end{equation}
!et
$D$ is here the diffusion constant. This example can be seen as a closed experiment, where the concentration is conserved. The relation between the flux and the $PDF$ can also be expressed
!bt
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial j(x,t)}{\partial x} = -\frac{\partial w(x,t)}{\partial t} 
\end{equation}
!et
And a diffusion equation can be expressed based on these two equations.
!bt
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial w(x,t)}{\partial t} = D\frac{\partial^2 w(x,t)}{\partial x^2} 
\end{equation}
!et
The expectation value and the variance, $\sigma^2$, can be study. The expectation value for the function $f(x,t)$ can be defined as
!bt
\begin{equation}
\langle f(x,t) \rangle = \int^{\infty}_{-\infty} f(x,t) w(x,t)dx
\end{equation}
!et
The demands defined for the PDF in the previous section have to be fulfilled for $w(x,t)$. The normalization condition which is defined for this PDF require constraints for equation.
!bt
\begin{equation} label{eq:PDF_demands}
w(x= \pm \infty,t) = 0,\quad \frac{\partial^nw(x,t)}{\partial x^n}|_{x=\pm\infty} = 0 
\end{equation}
!et
This can be used to study the time derivative of the expectation value. The diffusion equation derived earlier can be used here.
!bt
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial \langle f(x,t) \rangle}{\partial t} = \int^{\infty}_{-\infty} f(x,t) \frac{\partial w(x,t)}{\partial t}dx = D \int^{\infty}_{-\infty} f(x,t) \frac{\partial^2 w(x,t)}{\partial x^2}dx
\end{equation}
!et
By using integration by parts on the right side, the equation can be expressed,
!bt
\begin{equation} label{eq:disp_0}
\frac{\partial \langle f(x,t) \rangle}{\partial t} = D f(x,t) \frac{\partial w(x,t)}{\partial x}|_{x=\pm \infty} - 2D \int^{\infty}_{-\infty} \frac{\partial w(x,t)}{\partial x}dx
\end{equation}
!et
By using the demands from (ref{eq:PDF_demands}), the $\langle f(x,t) \rangle$ is independent of time. 
!bt
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial \langle f(x,t) \rangle}{\partial t} = 0
\end{equation}
!et
Implying that if a simulation of a random walk with equal probability of jumping in each direction, will end up with the probability distribution centered around the initial position. This may not be the case for the variance. By using (ref{eq:disp_0}), the $\langle x^2 \rangle $ can be found. 
!bt
\begin{equation} 
\frac{\partial \langle x^2 \rangle}{\partial t} = D x^2 \frac{\partial w(x,t)}{\partial x}|_{x=\pm \infty} - 2D \int^{\infty}_{-\infty} x\frac{\partial w(x,t)}{\partial x}dx
\end{equation}
!et
Here, integration by parts can be used. This results in
!bt
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial \langle x^2 \rangle}{\partial t} = D x w(x,t)|_{x=\pm \infty} + 2D \int^{\infty}_{-\infty} w(x,t)dx = 2D
\end{equation}
!et
this leads to
!bt
\begin{equation}
\langle x^2 \rangle = 2Dt
\end{equation}
!et
which gives the variance
!bt
\begin{equation} label{eq:diff_var}
\langle x^2 \rangle -\langle x \rangle^2 = 2Dt
\end{equation}
!et
And the square root of the variance can be expressed,
!bt
\begin{equation}
\sqrt{\langle x^2 \rangle -\langle x \rangle^2} = \sqrt{2Dt}
\end{equation}
!et
By comparing this with the displacement of a free particle, which moves with the function $x(t)=vt$ from the initial point, will the diffusion process moves with $\sqrt{\langle x^2 \rangle -\langle x \rangle^2} \propto \sqrt{t}$. This can be used to describe a random walk, and could say that a random walker escapes much more slowly than a free particle from the initial time. This can be seen in an example. 


======= Random walker =======
Now a random walker can be introduced in 1D. This can either jump to the left or to the right with a lenght of $\Delta x = l$. It is an equal probability for both directions. $L=R=1/2$. Then the average displacement will be 
!bt
\begin{equation}
 \langle x(n) \rangle = \sum^n_i \Delta x_i = 0, \quad \Delta x_i = \pm l,
\end{equation}
!et
after $n$ jumps. The variance can be found by first finding $\langle x(n)^2 \rangle$.
!bt
\begin{equation}
\langle x(n)^2 \rangle = \left(\sum^n_i \Delta x_i\right)\left(\sum^n_j \Delta x_j\right) = \sum^n_i \Delta x_i^2 + \sum^n_i \Delta x_i \Delta x_j = l^2n
\end{equation}
!et
The last term here will disappear after enough steps.  
!bt
\begin{equation}
\sum^n_i \Delta x_i \Delta x_j = 0
\end{equation}
!et
This gives the variance
!bt
\begin{equation}
\langle x(n)^2 \rangle-\langle x(n) \rangle^2 = l^2n
\end{equation}
!et
Now this variance from a random walker can be coupled with the variance from a diffusion equation. The variance from a diffusion equation is shown in the Appendix. By setting $n = t/\Delta t$. The random walker gets the following variance
!bt
\begin{equation}
\langle x(n)^2 \rangle-\langle x(n) \rangle^2 = l^2\frac{t}{\Delta t}
\end{equation}
!et
Then the diffusion constant in the diffusion equation can be replaced with
!bt
\begin{equation}
D = \frac{l^2}{\Delta t}
\end{equation}
!et
The variances between these two can be compared.

FIGURE:[3_fig/random_compare.png, height=500 width=800 frac=1] label{fig:gauss_random} 10000 random walkers placed at x=0 at t=0. Every step has the length $\Delta x = 0.01$ and with a random step every $\Delta t = 0.01$.

The standard deviation can be found for this simulation. This is given by the square root of the variance
!bt
\begin{equation}
\sigma = \sqrt{l^2\frac{t}{\Delta t}}
\end{equation}
!et

To study whether the average random walker develops as expected, a table with the outputs can be added. 

label{table:gauss_random}
|-----------------------------------------------|
|			|time=2     |time=8     |
|-----------------------------------------------|
|average displacement   |0.000662   | -0.002416 |
|standard deviation(SD) |0.1414     |  0.2828   |
|percent inside SD      |70.96      |69.02      |
|percent inside gauss   |68.26      |68.26      |
|-----------------------------------------------|

The average displacement and the standard deviation shows that a group of random walkers spread similarly as a standard diffusion function. This result in a major group of random walkers. In the simulation in Fig.(ref{fig:gauss_random}), 10000 random walkers are used. By increasing the amount om random walkers, the precision will be better.
