======= Discussion ODE models =======
The simulations of the example *English boarding school* was based on a basic SIR model, shown in Eq.(ref{eq:SIR_model}). The expected result was produced. The maximum concentration of the infected group could be found by using Eq.(ref{eq:max_I}). The value of $\Imax$ was first calculated for the example from ref{section:1_english} with the given parameter values. This was found to be $\Imax=292$. The numerical solution shown in Fig.(ref{fig:english_boarding}) gave the same result for $\Imax$.

With variations in the parameter value $\rho$, different epidemic results could be achieved. In section ref{section:1_english}, the value of $\rho$ was set to 202. By decreasing this value to 50, all students will be infected in during the 10 first days. While increasing the value of $\rho$ to 400, 170 students will remain in the susceptible group after 30 days.

The *Zombiefication* part was based on the model and phases from Langtangen, Mardal and RÃ¸tnes Ref.cite{zombie-math}. The parameters and the length of the phases were adjusted to simulate *Walking Dead*. Several assumptions were made from the writer to model this series. Since the simulations were based on expected results, the parameters were adjusted to fulfill these demands. The model produced the expected result for the groups, and one can say that the spread can be seen as possible based on these assumptions.

<linebreak>
The parameter values $\beta$, $\varrho$ and $\alpha$ from the model in Eq.(ref{eq:LMR_model}) were adjusted for the different phases in ref{section:1_zombiefication}. The effect of varying these parameters could be seen for the two groups *Susceptible* and *Removed* in Fig.(ref{fig:initial_parameters}) and Fig.(ref{fig:hysterical_variations}). The effect of varying $\beta$, which describes the number of susceptible humans that become infected, had major effect on the result for the susceptible group. The changes in $\alpha$, which describes the number of zombies killed by susceptible humans, affects the result in the removed group. The changes in $\varrho$, which describes the probability for an infected human to wake up as a zombie, affects the susceptible group in the *Initial phase*.  The effect for the *Hysterical phase* is close negligible. One can see that $\varrho$ has a greater effect on short simulations. By varying the different parameters in Eq.(ref{eq:LMR_model}), the expected result from *Walking Dead* was achieved.

The parameters found in this model will be used for all three chapters. This model is straight forward to calculate and is easy to use. The model is good if the goal is to find the total amount of each group measured over an area. The model requires that the parameters are given. The model gives no information about the spatial spread of the disease. This will therefore be useless in describing how a disease can spread abroad countries and borderlines. The next two chapters will introduce more complicated models which will take the spatial position into account. 



======= Discussion PDE models =======
This PDE model gave the opportunity to analyse epidemic diseases for a spatial area. The travelling wave is essential for a disease to spread in an area. If the reproduction rate seen in Eq.(ref{eq:reproduction_rate_PDF}) was below 1, the travelling wave would decrease towards zero and the disease would disapear. By varying $\lambda$, one could see that a low value would cause a total eradication of the susceptible group. By setting $\lambda>=1$, the damage from the epidemic wave would be close to zero and the disease would die out.

The results from the English boarding school shows that the position of the infected student has a major impact on the result. A uniform distribution was first calculated and compared with the ODE simulation in the previous chapter. This gave the same result. By placing the infected student in the center of the schoolyard, one can see after five days that the amount of susceptible is 68 percent higher, than with a uniform distribution. The amount of susceptible is even higher if the student is placed in the corner. Then the amount is 70 percent higher than for the uniform group. The results can be seen in Tab.(ref{table:british_number_table}). The results after 15 days shows that for the uniform distribution, there are 21 students left in the susceptible group and 724 in the removed group. The opposite result can be seen for the simulation with the infected in the corner. Here, the amount of susceptible and removed is 717 and 33.

The section ref{section:2_zombiefication} verified the uniform distributed PDF solution with the ODE solution from the previous chapter. These were expected to be similar. The English boarding school studied the result of varying the position of the infected with a uniform distributed group of susceptible. This section tried to expand this idea by split the group of susceptible into three constellations. The position of the zombie was placed in center of all three constellations. The loss of susceptible students in the *Initial phase* was proportional to the three constellations where the zombie was placed at initial time. For the small, middle and large constellation the loss of susceptible was 18,196 and 375 based on the Tab.(ref{table:compare_towns}). The percent based on the constellation is then: 86 percent for the small, 97 for the middle and 93 for the large constellation. The percent was highest for the middle group. This can be explained by the overlapping between the middle and the large constellations, seen in Fig.(ref{fig:initial_value_susceptible}). This overlapping resulted in a minor spread of the disease to the constellation next to. The position of the infected student was shown to have an impact on the spread of the disease in the section ref{section:2_english}. This section shows that the susceptible group also affects the result. An ODE model will therefore be weak, compared to an PDE model. An realistic assumption is that different groups will never be uniformed distributed, and the positions are shown to have a major effect.

<linebreak>  
The last part ref{section:2_frederikke} tries to implement human behavior by giving the susceptible group the ability to keep zombies outside the buildings. This is done by giving the groups: *Zombie* and *Infected* restricted areas. This was crucial in *Walking Dead* to prevent meetings between zombies and humans. The three similar constellations as in the previous section is used. However, the position has been changed. The middle constellation is placed in one of the buildings. By studying the Fig.(ref{fig:frederikke_free_area}), one can see that the zombie group is not able to diffuse into the buildings. The middle constellation will then avoid attacks. However, since the concentrations for each group will go towards equilibrium, the movement pattern for each group will differ from human behavior. The next chapter will use random walks to simulate this zombie outburst. This will build on the section ref{section:2_frederikke}, and introduce different conditions based on the phase the zombies and humans are in. 


======= Discussion Random walk =======
The results from the English boarding school shows that the maximum concentration of the infected, $\Imax$, is reduced when using random walk to simulate the disease. From the ODE and PDE simulations in the previous chapters, the value was $\Imax=292$. For the Random walk, the average $\Imax$ was 263. A susceptible person can only be infected every time step, and it can only happen once. This may affect the value of $\Imax$. To study this further, a couple of things could be done. The first is to simulate for a larger set of simulations. Here, the number of simulations was set to 200. A larger number would maybe give another result. The second is to study the random walk with shorter time steps. This may affect the result. 
<linebreak>  
<linebreak>  
As shown in section ref{section:1threshold_phenomenon} in chapter ref{section:ODE_models}, the reproduction rate, $R_0$, had to be above 1 for an epidemic situation to occur. The reproduction rate was calculated to be $R_0=3.77$ for the English boarding school. However, 25 percent of the simulations resulted in no epidemic situation. The infected student was transposed to the removed group before he was able to infect other students. 200 simulations was performed, and the percent may differ for a larger set of simulations. However, this result shows that when modelling closed systems, especially with a small group, an epidemic situation may not occur, even with a reproduction rate, $R_0$, above one.

<linebreak>  
The section ref{section:3_zombiefication} studied the effect of human behavior in an epidemic model. Therefore, the simulations were performed for minutes, to get the most realistic situation. The two conditions random walk and moving smart was simulated and compared with the uniform PDE solution from section ref{section:2_frederikke}. The random walk was based on a random movement pattern for all groups. The moving smart mode tried to give humans and zombies a more realistic behavior. Based on *Walking Dead*, the humans would avoid the zombies, while the zombies would strive to take the humans. This is reflected in the condition *Moving smart*. When simulating the condition *Moving smart* with only one zombie at initial time, the zombie was never able to reach any of the susceptible humans. This lead to no increase of the zombie group. The simulations have therefore been done with 10 zombies at initial time. When studying the Tab.(ref{table:frederikke_table_random}), one can see that the condition *Moving smart* gives the zombie group an advantage. There are 72 susceptible left after 3 minutes in the uniform PDE simulation, while the average simulation of random walk results in 279 susceptible humans. This supports the conclusion from section ref{section:2_discussion}, that the position of the groups is a major factor in modelling the spread of disease. A random walker can only be at one place at the time. The result from moving smart, makes the zombie attack more aggressive. The average result for the susceptible group after 3 minutes is 87 humans. The condition *Moving smart* resulted in eradication for the susceptible group in 15 of the 100 simulations after three minutes. At final time, the number was increased to 29 cases of eradication for the susceptible group.

<linebreak>
The two lasts sections consists of simulations of all three phases from *Walking Dead*. These are modeled for a shorter time than the series. However, these simulations gives some interesting results. The movement pattern for the *Initial phase* is randomly for both cases, while the *Hysterical phase* consists of the condition *Moving smart* explained above. In Tab.(ref{table:compare_ODE_random}), the effect of restricted areas for the zombies gives a higher amount of susceptible humans. While there are 274 humans left in the average random walk simulation after the *Initial phase*, there are 331 susceptible humans left for the average simulations with restricted areas for the zombie group. Compared to the ODE simulation were 71 susceptible humans are left, one can say that by adding human behavior, the susceptible group gets an advantage. Random walk models will be able to produce more realistic models, related to human behavior, than the two other models. 



========= Discussion and conclusion =========
Through this thesis, two examples have been used to compare and simulate the different epidemic models. The results from these cases will be used to analyse the three models. A summarize of the three models will be done, before ideas for further work will be presented.
<linebreak>
<linebreak>
The case *English boarding school* was first simulated for the ODE model. This simulation was based on given parameter values from the British medical journal. One could see that the maximum concentration of the infected group could be found by Eq.(ref{eq:max_I}), and the numerical simulation gave the same result. By adjusting the parameter $\rho$ in Fig.(ref{fig:english_boarding}), the result from the epidemic disease changed. When $\rho$ was set to 50, it lead to total eradication of susceptible students during the 10 first days. While increasing $\rho$ to 400, the amount of susceptible students was 170. When introducing the PDE model, one could compare these models. The PDE model was first simulated for the *English boarding school* with uniform distribution. This gave the same result, and was expected. However, then the infected student was placed in center, the amount of susceptible students after 5 days increased with 68 percent. The disease was now less effective and one could see from Fig.(ref{fig:gauss_sub}) that the disease only spread to the students in the center. By place the student in the corner, the number of susceptible after 5 days was increased to 70 percent, compared to the ODE model. Both models have used the same parameter values and the same size, but the results differ widely. In both ODE model and PDE model, the maximum value of infected was found to be $\Imax=292$. This was not the result from the Random walk simulation. Here average maximum value of the infected was $\Imax=263$, and is quite much lower than for the other models. By studying Fig.(ref{fig:english_school_random}), one can see that the infected ODE always is within the range of the standard deviation for the random walk simulation. The average value for the random walk is based on 200 simulations. Further work would be to increase this number to see if the average value would change. Another element that the random walk model add, is the chance for an epidemic disease to die out. 25 percent of the simulations resulted in no epidemic situation. The infected student was transposed to the removed group before he was able to infect other students. This would not be the case for the ODE and PDE model, since the reproduction rate was above one, explained in section ref{section:1threshold_phenomenon}.  
<linebreak>  
<linebreak>  
The second example was based on the TV series *Walking Dead*. Here, the amount for each group was known, and the parameter values for the ODE model were adjusted to fit the expected result. The parameter values $\beta$, $\varrho$ and $\alpha$ from the model in Eq.(ref{eq:LMR_model}) were adjusted for the different phases in *Walking Dead*. Based on this, the evolution can be seen as realistic in *Walking Dead*, based on this model. However, it does not take the spatial factor into account. The PDE model was verified by simulating *Walking Dead* with uniform distribution. The position of the infected student was shown to have an effect on the result for the *English boarding school*. Here, the susceptible group was split into three groups, called constellations. The zombie was placed in all three groups, to study the effect. The simulations showed that the loss of susceptible was proportional to the constellation where the zombie was placed. For the small, middle and large constellation the loss of susceptible was 18,196 and 375 based on the Tab.(ref{table:compare_towns}). The middle group had the highest amount compared to the size of the constellation, given by 97 percent. The PDE simulations showed that the distribution of the susceptible group also affected the result. The last simulations for the PDE model tried to implement human behavior. This was done by giving the zombie and infected restricted areas, by keeping them outside the buildings. The simulation shown in Fig.(ref{fig:frederikke_free_area}) gave the susceptible group in the buildings a greater chance of surviving. However, since the concentrations for each group in an PDE model goes towards equilibrium, the movement pattern differs from human behavior. This behavior is easier to apply to the Random walk model. The simulations for the Random walk model were run for a short time, to study the effect from the human behavior. The condition *Moving smart*, where the zombies chase the susceptible humans, was used. With only one zombie at initial time, it resulted in zero loss for the susceptible group. Since the moving speed has been set to equal, the humans were able to avoid battles. Therefore, the simulation was performed with 10 zombies at initial time. This resulted in 87 humans after 3 minutes, compared to 297 humans for the random walk simulation. These results are based on the average value of a set of simulations. For the simulations with the condition *Moving smart*, 15 of 100 simulations resulted in eradication of the susceptible group after 3 minutes, and after 10 minutes the result was increased to 29 simulations. This was not the case for any of the simulations with the random walk condition. However, the condition *Moving smart* will no be a realistic movement pattern in all situations. The last simulations for the Random walk model, combined these conditions. In the *Initial phase*, the condition is set to random walk, while it changed in the *Hysterical phase* to the moving smart condition. One set of simulations was run with the ability for all groups to move freely over the area, while another set of simulations was model with restricted areas for the zombie group. These were compared with the ODE simulation from the first chapter. The parameter values and the amount is equal for all three simulations. After the *Initial phase*, 71 susceptible were left in the ODE simulation, 278 for the simulation were the groups could move freely and 331 for the simulation done with restricted areas for the zombies. By adding human behavior to the model, it increases the chance for humans to survive.
<linebreak>
<linebreak>
To summarize these results, the ODE model can be adapted to problems, where the amount for each group is given. However, it does not take the spatial effect into account. This makes the model weak, if the idea is to predict the spread of a disease. The PDE model is able to use the spatial information. The results from *English boarding school* and *Waling Dead* showed the effect of the position. When adding human behavior, this model becomes weak. It is difficult to apply movement pattern that can be seen as realistic, specially for small groups. The random walk model was able to take the spatial effect into account and add human behavior. These two factors gave the most realistic simulations. The drawback was the high calculating capacity. The longest random walk simulation was performed for 34 minutes. To simulate long simulations with a higher amount, it demands more calculating capacity than for the other models.  

===== Further work =====
It would be interesting to expand the random model by using parallelization. The model could be expanded in size, and simulated for a longer time. The code has been written in python, which results in a slow simulating. By using faster programming languages, the simulations could be performed more efficient. The idea was to simulate the Random walk model for the same time length, as for the ODE model. This was not possible in this thesis, because of the demanding calculating capacity.
<linebreak>
<linebreak>
Another idea would be to add more skills to the different groups in Random walk. And study if these conditions could compensate for the change in parameter values. The skills and strengh for a human was similar for all in the susceptible group. This is not the case in the real world. All humans have different skills and would behave different in meeting with a zombie. Interesting skills to add would be:
* weapons for the susceptible group
* noise sensitive for the zombie group
* The ability to cooperate in the groups.
This would all make the random walk model more realistic in the idea of simulating a zombie outburst.
<linebreak>
<linebreak>
The movement speed has been equal for all three groups *Susceptible*, *Infected* and *Zombie* in this thesis. Based on the series *Walking Dead*, the average speed was higher for the susceptible group, than for the two others. Further work could have study how this would have affect the result.
