===== Dynamics of Infectious Diseases =====

The model consist of three different groups
* *Susceptible* ($S$), who are humans that are healthy and at risk of becoming infected. 
* *Infective* ($I$), who are humans who have the disease or are carriers of the disease. This group can infect the *Susceptible*. 
* *Removed* ($R$),who are dead or recovering humans, often people that already have had the disease.

A simple epidemic model can be expressed as follows
!bt
\begin{equation} label{eq:SIR_model}
	\begin{aligned} 
	\frac{dS}{dt} &= -rSI \\ 
	\frac{dI}{dt} &= rSI-aI \\ 
	\frac{dR}{dt} &= aI 
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
!et
Here $r$ describes the the transmission from the *Susceptible* group to the *Infected* group. $a$ describes the percent of infected that dies. Since the system is closed, the total number will be constant.

!bt
\begin{equation}
\frac{dS}{dt} + \frac{dI}{dt} + \frac{dR}{dt} = 0
\end{equation}
!et

Therefore the total size of the population, $N$, will be constant. 
!bt
\begin{equation} label{eq:SIR_N}
S(t)+I(t)+R(t) = N
\end{equation}
!et
!split
===== Threshold value =====
To cause an epidemic situation, the model needs to fulfill $I(t)= I_0$ for some $t>0$
!bt
\begin{equation}
S(0)=S_0 > 0,\hspace{8mm} I(0)=I_0>0,\hspace{8mm} R(0) =0.
\end{equation}
!et
The initial conditions for *Susceptible* and *Infective* combined with $r$ and $a$ will control the epidemic situation. These will affect the spread of the infection. From equation (ref{eq:SIR_model}) the function for *Infective* at initial time can be written,
!bt
\begin{equation}
\left[\frac{dI}{dt}\right]_{t=0} = I_0(rS_0-a)
\end{equation}
!et
The expression inside the brackets controls the change in $I$. The function will increase if $S_0 > \frac{a}{r}$, this will therefore be the threshold value for the function. The threshold value will be described by the variable $\rho$,
!bt
\begin{equation} label{eq:threshold_value}
\rho = \frac{a}{r}
\end{equation}
!et
This can be shown with some phase trajectories of the *Susceptible* and the *Infective* in figure(ref{fig:threshold_phenomenon}).  

FIGURE:[../spesialpensum_SIR/plots/threshold_phenomenon.png]label{fig:threshold_phenomenon} Simulations of the SIR model (ref{eq:SIR_model}) with start positions along the blue line. $I$ increases until $S$ is equal to the threshold value $\rho$, which is sat to 35. Then $I$ is reduced to 0. In the simulations where $S_0 < \rho$, no epidemic situation is achieved.    

!split
===== English boarding school =====
The British medical journal had in 1978 a report from a boarding school in England. One of the boys had brought with him a disease back to the school. Since this was a boarding school, they were totally isolated from others and had a closed system to model cite[p.~325]{murray2002mathematical}. The simulation can be seen in figure(ref{fig:english_boarding})  

FIGURE:[../spesialpensum_SIR/plots/English_boarding_school.png] label{fig:english_boarding} An English boarding school is modeled for 15 days with the following parameters: $N=763$, $S_0=762$, $I_0=1$, $R_0=0$, $\rho=202$ and $r=2.18 x 10^{-3}$. An increasing of *Infective* can be seen since $S_0 > \rho$.

The parameter value $\rho$ has a major impact on the result. The epidemic disease could turn out quite different than in the situation in figure(ref{fig:english_boarding}) by variations in $a$ and $r$. Figure(ref{fig:rho_changes}) consist of some examples where $\rho$ varies from 50 to 400.

FIGURE:[../spesialpensum_SIR/plots/English_boarding_school_changes.png] label{fig:rho_changes} In the first plot where $\rho=50$, the *Infective* will increase until the number of *Susceptible* falls down to 50. This will result in a majority of infected students. In the last plot where $\rho=400$, the total number of *Susceptible* stays around 170 students and will go towards a steady number as $I(\infty)=0$.

======= When Zombies Attack! =======
===== Basic model =====

!bt
\begin{align*}
\frac{dS}{dt} =& \Sigma -\beta SZ - \delta S \\
\frac{dI}{dt} =& \beta SZ - \varrho I - \delta I\\
\frac{dZ}{dt} =& \varrho I + \zeta R - \alpha SZ\\
\frac{dR}{dt} =& \delta S + \delta I + \alpha SZ - \zeta R
\end{align*}
!et
This is a bit more complicated than the standard $SEIR$ model. A presentation of the parameters;
* $\Sigma$ describes the birthrate for new *Susceptible*. $\frac{dS}{dt}$ is now able to be positive. This is now not a closed system. 
* $\beta SZ$ describes the numbers of *Susceptible* that become *Infected* , based on interactions between zombies and humans. Similar as the case for $rSI$ in the SIR model. 
* $\delta$ describes the number of naturals deaths among the group. This is used in the *Susceptible* and the *Infected* group
* $\varrho I$ describes the probability for an infected human to wake up as a zombie.
* $\zeta R$ controls the number of *Removed* that arises as *Zombie*. 
* $\alpha SZ$ describes the number of zombies killed by humans in the zombie attacks. 

This ODE satisfy
!bt
\begin{equation}
S'+I'+Z'+R' = \Sigma
\end{equation}
!et
Which leads to
!bt
\begin{equation}
S + I + Z + R \rightarrow  \infty
\end{equation}
!et
When $t \rightarrow \infty$ and $\Sigma \neq 0$, $S$ cannot go towards infinity, which results in a "doomsday" and this will lead to a collapse of the civilisation.

======= Escaping the zombie Threat by Mathematics =======
===== LMR model =====
In the paper from Munz et. al cite{munz2009zombies} the doomsday was nearly inevitable. This is criticized by Langtagen, Mardal and Røtnes. In the paper *Escaping the zombie Threat by Mathematics* cite{zombie-math}, the doomsday scenario is questioned.
* Counter attack can be performed earlier and with more destruction
* Magic is not involved. Laws of physics and biology are used

The model that they use:
!bt
\begin{equation} label{eq:LMR_model}
	\begin{aligned} 
	\frac{dS}{dt} =& \Sigma -\beta SZ - \delta_SS \\
	\frac{dI}{dt} =& \beta SZ - \varrho I - \delta_II\\
	\frac{dZ}{dt} =& \varrho I- (\alpha+\omega(t))SZ + \zeta R\\
	\frac{dR}{dt} =& \delta_SS +\delta_II -\zeta R + (\alpha+\omega(t))SZ 
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
!et
The main change is the $\omega(t)$. This is a Gaussian curve and can be seen in eq(ref{eq:omega}).
!bt
\begin{equation} label{eq:omega}
\omega(t) = a \sum^m_{i=0}\exp\left(\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{t-T_i}{\sigma}\right)^2\right)
\end{equation}
!et

$\omega(t)$ controls the attacks from the *Susceptible*, which will be fired at predefined time steps. These are controlled by the three parameters. 
* $a$ here works as a similar parameter as $\alpha$, but will only be activated when the *Susceptible* group is organized and ready to attack. 
* $T$ contains a list of numbers, which controls the time when the attacks will occur.
* $\sigma$ controls the length of the attack.

===== Use model to simulate Walking Dead =====
In *Escaping the zombie Threat by Mathematics* cite{zombie-math}, the movie *The Night of The Living Dead* is used. These simulations are based on the TV series *Walking Dead*. The paper divide a zombie outbreaks into three phases:
* _Initial phase_ : The humans are unfamiliar with the disease in this phase and acts quite naive to the disease. This result in a high chance of getting infected. Lasts for a short period. In this case, three days 
* _Hysterical phase_ : The humans are now more familiar with the situation and tries to avoid the infected ones. This result in a lower chance of getting infected. 
* _Counter attack_ : The last phase, which happens at the same time as the hysterical phase. This phase is often started when humans are attacked by zombies. They will then respond with a counter attack to save themselves.

Data from the TV series by close studies.

|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
|---------|Initial phase|hysterical phase|counter attack|final values|
|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
|S_0      |621          | 71          | 62              |58          |
|I_0      |0            | 540         | 360             |332         |
|Z_0      |1            | ---         | ---             |---         |
|R_0      |0            | 20          | 200             |232         |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------|

To be able to achieve these results, the parameters have to be adjusted. To model all three phases, the parameters in in the table are used 

|-------------------------------------------------------|
|parameter|Initial phase|hysterical phase|counter attack|
|-------------------------------------------------------|
|$\beta$  |0.01155      | 0.000011       | 0.00011      |
|$\varrho$|1.37         | 1.5            | 1.5          |
|$\alpha$ |0.00044      | 0.000208       | 0.000208     |
|a        |0            | 0              | 0.0073       |
|$\sigma$ |0            | 0              | 0.005        |
|$\mu$    |0            | 0              | 0.14         |
|-------------------------------------------------------|

This result in the simulation

FIGURE:[../spesialpensum_SIR/plots/WD_zombie_all_phases_1.png] label{fig:all_phases} Walking Dead simulated after 5 episodes. Based on the three different phases.

The results can be seen in the following table

======= Murray PDE =======
===== Travelling wave =====
!bt
\begin{equation} label{eq:simple_PDE}
	\begin{aligned}
	\frac{\partial S}{\partial t} &= -rIS + D\nabla ^2 S\\
	\frac{\partial I}{\partial t} &= rIS- aI + D\nabla ^2 I\\
	\frac{\partial R}{\partial t} &= aI + D\nabla ^2 R
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
!et
This problem can be nondimensionalized by writing
!bt
\begin{equation} label{eq:constants_nondimensional}
	\begin{aligned}
	I^* =\frac{I}{S_0},&\quad I^* = \frac{I}{S_0},&\quad R^*= \frac{R}{S_0},&\\
	x^* =\left(\frac{rS_0}{D}\right)^{1/2}x,&\quad t^*=rS_0t,&\quad \lambda =\frac{a}{rS_0},&
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
!et
And the following system can be study:
!bt
\begin{equation} label{eq:simple_non_PDE}
	\begin{aligned}
	\frac{\partial S}{\partial t} &= -IS + \frac{\partial^2 S}{\partial x^2},\\
	\frac{\partial I}{\partial t} &= IS- \lambda I + \frac{\partial^2 I}{\partial x^2},\\
	\frac{\partial R}{\partial t} &= \lambda I + \frac{\partial^2 R}{\partial x^2},
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
!et
An epidemic wave can be seen in Fig.(ref{fig:1D_sub}). The value of $\lambda$ is sat to 0.5. The initial value for *Susceptible* is 1 for the area and the *Removed* is sat to 0. The *Infected* class has a Gauss curve around 0 at initial time. In the four subplots in Fig.(ref{fig:1D_sub}), the epidemic wave travel towards the other side. The value $z$, which is defined in Eq.(ref{eq:trav_para}), is used to plot the travelling wave measured at a specific point, in this case $x=15$. This travelling wave is shown in figure(ref{fig:1D_tw}).       

FIGURE:[../2_PDE_Fisher_Kolmogoroff/plots/trav_wave_sub.png,height=600 width=800 frac=0.8] label{fig:1D_sub} The system (ref{eq:ord_diff_sys}. A gaussian curve with height 0.2 placed on the left side. This causes an epidemic wave controlled by the parameter $\lambda=0.5$. The size is measured at point $x=15$ and can be seen in figure (ref{fig:1D_tw}). 

FIGURE:[../2_PDE_Fisher_Kolmogoroff/plots/epidemic_wave_z_lambda_0_5.png] label{fig:1D_tw} This shows the travelling wave measures at at $x=15$ in figure(ref{fig:1D_sub})

===== Geographic spread =====
The model (ref{eq:LMR_model}) can be expanded with a diffusion term added to each equation
!bt
\begin{equation} label{eq:seland_model}
	\begin{aligned} 
	\frac{\partial S}{\partial t} =& \Sigma -(\beta+\mu \omega(t))SZ - \delta_SS +D_s\nabla^2 S \\
	\frac{\partial I}{\partial t} =& (\beta+\mu \omega(t))SZ - \varrho I - \delta_II+D_i\nabla^2 I\\
	\frac{\partial Z}{\partial t} =& \varrho I- (\alpha+\omega(t))SZ + \zeta R+D_z\nabla^2 Z\\
	\frac{\partial R}{\partial t} =& \delta_SS +\delta_II -\zeta R + (\alpha+\omega(t))SZ+D_r\nabla^2 R 
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
!et
