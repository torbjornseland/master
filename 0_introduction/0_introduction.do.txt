========= Introduction =========
This thesis will study and compare three different models for simulating epidemic diseases. The three models that will be used are: ODE models, PDE models and Random walk. Each model will be be presented and studies of the specific model will be done. In the first chapter, ref{section:ODE_models}, the threshold value for an epidemic disease will be studied. The second chapter, ref{section:PDE_models}, will study how a travelling wave of infected disperse in an area. The third chapter, ref{section:Random_walk}, will look into monte carlo simulations. Which will be used for the Random walk simulations. The results from the different models will be compared and analysed trough the thesis.

A couple of choices have been done for this thesis. First, the systems will be modeled for a short period of time. The length of the longest simulations is a month, while the third chapter only consists of simulations with the length of half an hour. This is done to study the human behavior and influence in a zombie attack. Second, all models are simulated as closed systems. The amount in each simulation never exceeds 763 humans and the time aspect is short. Therefore the birth and death rate is close to negligible, and are set to zero.

This paper will use two different examples for all three models. The first case is based on an influenza outbreak which occurred at a English boarding school in 1978. A basic SIR system will be used to model the epidemic trough 15 days. This example shows the effect of varying the parameter values in the system. This will be done in chapter ref{section:ODE_models}. The maximum concentration of infected humans will be compared, to see if the results between the models differ. The spatial effect from the two spatial model in ref{section:PDE_models} and ref{section:Random_walk} will be compared against the ODE model, to study the effect of spatial dispersion. The second example is based on the TV series *Walking Dead*.  

The TV series *Walking Dead* has through several seasons shown the result of a zombiefication. Some studies, for instance papers by Munz et. al Ref.cite{munz2009zombies} and Langtangen,Mardal & Røtnes Ref.cite{zombie-math}, can be mentioned. This thesis will use these papers and develop the models further. It will focus on the first five episodes in the first season of *Walking Dead* Ref.cite{walking_dead}, and use parameter values based on this series.

Throughout the history great epidemic diseases have spread across the world,leading to catastrophic consequences for human populations. Millions of lives have been taken. The Black Death and Cholera are epidemics that have moved over large distances into Europe. When the Black Death came to Europe in 1347, it killed about a third of the population, which at that time was approximately 85 million people Ref.cite[p.~315]{murray2002mathematical}. These diseases often gave physical symptoms, which have contributed to important knowledge in how to prevent new outbursts and to cure already infected humans. The outbreaks vary, but they are often related to interaction between humans and animals. Malaria is an example of a disease that transmits from mosquitoes to humans. There have been various explanations of the spread and cause of epidemics. AIDS was ascribed by many as a punishment sent by God, and the cause of the Black death was believed to be $"$bad air $"$ during the 14th century. Today, it is known that most of these epidemics originated in animals and spread to humans due to interaction Ref.cite[p.~316]{murray2002mathematical}.

The first major epidemic in the USA was the Yellow Fever. It broke out in Philadelphia in 1793, and took nearly 5000 lives. A disease can easily take more lives than a war. Also, 20 000 people fled the city, which resulted in an even more chaotic situation Ref.cite[p.~316]{murray2002mathematical}. This had a major impact on the subsequent life and politics of the country.

Another important aspect in the current spread of diseases, is the displacement of human populations. About a million people cross international borders daily. The growth of human population, especially in underdeveloped countries, is another factor that affects the spread. These developments played a key role in the spread of HIV in the 1980's. The World Health Organization has estimated that around 32.6 million people are infected with the HIV virus today Ref.cite{who_hiv}.

Several scientific and mathematical studies have been done on different diseases through the years, for instance on HIV/AIDS. *Mathematical Modelling of the Transmission Dynamics of HIV Infection and AIDS: a Review* was published in 1988 by Valerie Isham Ref.cite{isham1988mathematical}. This paper focuses on modeling transmission of infection in an AIDS epidemic. In 1999 Alan S. Perelson and Patrick W. Nelson published *Mathematical Analysis of HIV-1 Dynamics in Vivo* Ref.cite{perelson1999mathematical}. They studied the dynamics of HIV-1 pathogenesis to AIDS. Their focus was rapid dynamical processes that occur in short time scales, as hours, while AIDS occurs on a time scale of about 10 years. This affects the way that AIDS patients are treated with drugs. *Predicting the HIV/AIDS epidemic and measuring the effect of mobility in mainland China* by Xiao et. al Ref.cite{xiao2013predicting} is another study done on HIV/AIDS. This study focused on the geographic variation in the severity of the epidemic in China.

This thesis will study three mathematical models used to simulate epidemic diseases. The first chapter will use an ODE system to model the different groups that are included in an epidemic disease. The chapter will study the variations in each group based on different time aspects. The second chapter will look at a PDE system. This model also takes the spatial spread into account, and the position affects the result. A random walk system is studied in the third chapter. In the two first chapters, the amount of each group is viewed as concentrations. In the third chapter, each person will be modeled as a particle. The person's behavior will be based on the group it belongs to and its time and position.
