Throughout history large epidemic diseases have spread around the world, often over large geographical areas. These diseases have done great harm on the population and millions of people have died. The Black Death and Cholera are epidemics that have moved over large distances into Europe. When the Black Death came to Europe in 1347, it killed about a third of the population, which at that time was about 85 million people cite[p.~315]{murray2002mathematical}. These diseases often gave physical symptoms, which have given important knowledge through history to prevent new outbursts and to cure already infected humans. They have various outbreaks, but are often related to connections between humans and animals. Malaria is an example of a disease that transmits from mosquitoes to humans. There have also been various explanations of the spread and cause of epidemics. AIDS(autoimmune deficiency syndrome) has as an example been ascribed by many as a punishment sent by God.cite[p.~316]{murray2002mathematical}.

The first major epidemic in the U.S.A was the Yellow Fever, discovered in 1793 in Philadelphia. 5000 of a population of 50 000 died. About 20 000 fled the city and the situation was quite chaoticcite[p.~316]{murray2002mathematical}. This had a major impact on the subsequent life and politics of the country. The power of a disease can do larger damage, with respect to death, than a war.

After World War II, public health strategy has focused on elimination and control of organisms which cause disease. In 1978 United Nations sat a goal of eradicating all diseases by year 2000. A large job has been done and smallpox is an example of a disease that was last seen in Somalia in 1977[Ref:cdc.gov]. AIDS was later recognized and has been difficult to stop the spread.

Another important aspect in the current spread of diseases, is the displacement of human populations. About a million people cross international borders daily. The growth of human population, especially in underdeveloped countries, is a factor that affects the spread. These conditions played a key role in the spread of HIV(human immunodeficiency) in the 1980's. World Health Organization has estimated that around 32.6 million are infected with the HIV virus today[web:http://www.who.int/features/factfiles/hiv/en/].

Knowledge through history is important for the control of different epidemics, but also important in detecting new diseases. The plague of Athens had been studied in great detail by Thucydides in 430-438 BC. Similar had been done with the 'sweating sickness' in the late 15th and first of the 16th centuries in England. The symptoms of 'sweating sickness' was detected in 1993 in the Southwest U.S.A. Here the disease was called hanta virus. There is likely that this is the same disease, but that the 'sweating sickness' has been dormant for couple of hundred years.cite[p.~317]{murray2002mathematical}.

There have been done several mathematical studies on different diseases. HIV/AIDS is a field which has been studied by several scientists through the years. *Mathematical Modelling of the Transmission Dynamics of HIV Infection and AIDS: a Review* was published in 1988 by Valerie Isham cite{isham1988mathematical}. This paper focuses on modelling transmission of infection in the context of AIDS epidemic.In 1999 Alan S. Perelson and Patrick W. Nelson published *Mathematical Analysis of HIV-1 Dynamics in Vivo* cite{perelson1999mathematical}. They studied the dynamics of HIV-1 pathogenesis to AIDS, where they looked at rapid dynamical processes that occur in short time scales, as hours, while AIDS occurs on a time scale of about 10 years. This affect the way that AIDS patients are treated with drugs. *Predicting the HIV/AIDS epidemic and measuring the effect of mobility in mainland China* by Xiao et. al cite{xiao2013predicting} is another study done on HIV/AIDS where they look at the geographic variation in the severity of the epidemic in China. The models in this study are built on the basic ODE model shown in the next section. These three papers show some of the variation in both time and research when it comes to the study of diseases. The next section will describe a simple epidemic model and analyse the data this model can give.
