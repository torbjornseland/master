I would also like to thank my fellow students in B1002 for their company and good support. I am very grateful for the constructive feedback from Ada and Aslak on my thesis. My English was improved by the good help from my sister-in-law, Trine.

Finally, I would like to thank my two favorite girls, my daughter Tiril and my wife Silje, for supporting me with constant love and comfort.
